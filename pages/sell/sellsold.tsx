            : Are you expecting new family members such as a baby, or are your
            college kids moving out, or might an aging parent move in? Life
            changes like these may make your current living quarters feel too
            small, or large, or just no longer suit your needs. Career changes
            such as a new job thatâ€™s farther away might also mean it makes sense
            to move, or if you now work mostly from home, this could free you up
            to live just about anywhere. Make sure to consider your personal
            circumstances as well as market conditions when deciding whether the
            time is right for you to sell.

            : If a job loss or divorce has made your current mortgage payments
            unmanageable, it may be smart to cut your losses and downsize to a
            home within your means. People close to retirement may also want to
            sell so they can move to an area with better weather or a more
            relaxed pace, or into a home with fewer maintenance hassles like a
            huge yard or swimming pool.
